# ü•â Bronze Layer: The Possibility Engine

This script is the **foundational data generation layer** of the entire strategy discovery pipeline. Its purpose is to systematically scan historical price data and generate a vast, high-quality dataset of every conceivable winning trade based on a predefined set of rules.

This "universe of possibilities" forms the bedrock upon which all subsequent analysis is built.

## What It Is

The Bronze Layer is a high-performance, parallelized Python script that performs a "brute-force" simulation. For every single candle in a historical dataset, it simulates thousands of potential `buy` and `sell` trades, each with a different Stop-Loss (SL) and Take-Profit (TP) combination. It then looks forward in time to see which of these hypothetical trades would have resulted in a win.

The final output is a massive CSV file‚Äîthe **Bronze Dataset**‚Äîcontaining a detailed log of every successful trade simulation.

## Why It Is

Quantitative trading research begins with a simple question: "What has worked in the past?" This script answers that question in the most comprehensive way possible.

Instead of starting with a biased idea (e.g., "let's test a moving average crossover"), we start with the outcome. By generating a complete dataset of _all_ profitable trades first, we create an unbiased foundation. The subsequent layers (Silver, Platinum) can then mine this data to discover the market conditions and indicators that were predictive of these successful outcomes.

This "outcome-first" approach is designed to uncover hidden, non-obvious patterns that traditional strategy development might miss.

## How It Works

The script is engineered for maximum speed and memory safety to handle the billions of simulations it needs to perform.

1.  **File Discovery & Configuration:** The script scans the `raw_data/` directory for input CSV files. It intelligently parses each filename (e.g., `XAUUSD15.csv`) to determine the instrument and timeframe.
2.  **Smart Configuration Loading:** Based on the detected instrument and timeframe, it loads two key sets of parameters:
    - **SL/TP Presets:** Timeframe-specific ranges for generating SL and TP ratios, accounting for different volatility levels.
    - **Spread Costs:** Instrument-specific spread values (e.g., 1.5 pips for EURUSD, 20 pips for XAUUSD) to ensure the simulations are realistic.
3.  **Parallel Processing:** It uses Python's `multiprocessing` library to process multiple input files in parallel. By default, it utilizes all but two available CPU cores (`cpu_count() - 2`) to ensure the system remains responsive during processing.
4.  **Chunked Input Processing:** To keep RAM usage low, the main historical data file is not processed all at once. It is read in smaller **input chunks** (e.g., 10,000 candles at a time) with a calculated overlap to ensure continuity.
5.  **Numba-Accelerated Simulation:** Each small chunk is handed off to a core simulation function that has been JIT-compiled with `numba`. This transforms the computationally intensive nested loops into C-like machine code, resulting in a massive speedup (10-50x) compared to pure Python.
6.  **Memory-Safe Output:** The millions of winning trades generated by the Numba function are collected in an in-memory accumulator. Once this accumulator reaches a set size (`OUTPUT_CHUNK_SIZE`), the data is formatted and appended to the final output CSV on disk, and the memory is cleared. This allows the script to generate enormous, multi-gigabyte files without ever crashing due to low memory.

## üìà Input & Output

### Input File Format (`raw_data/`)

The script expects raw data files in a standard OHLC format. The filename must follow a specific pattern for auto-configuration: **`[INSTRUMENT][TIMEFRAME].csv`**.

- **Examples:** `EURUSD15.csv`, `XAUUSD60.csv`, `GBPUSD1.csv`
- **Columns (headerless):** `time, open, high, low, close, [volume]`
  - The script is robust and will work with or without a volume column.

### Output File Format (`bronze_data/`)

The output is a single, large CSV file for each input file, containing a log of all discovered winning trades.

| Column        | Description                                            | Example               |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `entry_time`  | Timestamp of the candle where the trade was initiated. | `2023-10-18 14:30:00` |
| `trade_type`  | The direction of the trade.                            | `buy` or `sell`       |
| `entry_price` | The closing price of the entry candle.                 | `1925.45`             |
| `sl_price`    | The calculated Stop-Loss price for this trade.         | `1921.20`             |
| `tp_price`    | The calculated Take-Profit price for this trade.       | `1935.90`             |
| `sl_ratio`    | The stop-loss percentage used (e.g., 0.5%).            | `0.005`               |
| `tp_ratio`    | The take-profit percentage used (e.g., 1.0%).          | `0.010`               |
| `exit_time`   | Timestamp of the candle where the Take-Profit was hit. | `2023-10-18 17:15:00` |
| `outcome`     | The result of the trade (always "win" in this layer).  | `win`                 |

## üöÄ Possible Enhancements & Future Improvements

1.  **Dynamic Lookahead:** The `MAX_LOOKFORWARD` parameter is currently fixed per timeframe. A more advanced version could calculate the average volatility (e.g., using ATR) and dynamically adjust the lookahead period, potentially speeding up simulations in low-volatility environments.
2.  **Generate Losing Trades:** For some advanced modeling techniques (like building a binary classifier), it would be beneficial to also have a dataset of losing trades. An option could be added to the script to generate and save a `bronze_data/losses/{instrument}.csv` file. This would dramatically increase the data size but could enable different types of analysis in later layers.
3.  **Alternative Exit Logic:** The current model only considers SL/TP exits. The engine could be expanded to include other exit conditions, such as a time-based stop (e.g., "exit trade if not profitable after N candles").
4.  **Configuration File:** The `TIMEFRAME_PRESETS` and `SPREAD_Pips` dictionaries are currently hardcoded. For easier tuning and experimentation, these could be moved to an external `config.yaml` or `config.json` file.
