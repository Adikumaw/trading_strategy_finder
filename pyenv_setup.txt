1. Install pyenv-win: 
If you haven't already, install pyenv-win by running the following command in PowerShell: 
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1"

This script will clone the pyenv-win repository and set up the necessary environment variables. You might need to restart your terminal or computer for the changes to take effect. 
2. Install Python versions using pyenv-win: 
Use pyenv-win to install the desired Python versions. For example, to install Python 3.9.0: 
pyenv install 3.9.0

3. Install pyenv-virtualenv (or use venv): 
While pyenv-virtualenv is a plugin for the original pyenv, pyenv-win has its own way of handling virtual environments, often relying on Python's built-in venv module. 

â€¢ Using venv (recommended for modern Python versions): 

For Python 3.3 and later, venv is built-in and generally preferred. You can create a virtual environment directly using the installed Python version: 
    pyenv shell 3.9.0 # or whichever version you want to use
    or
    pyenv local 3.9.0 
    
    python -m venv my_project_env

Then, activate it: 
    .\my_project_env\Scripts\activate
